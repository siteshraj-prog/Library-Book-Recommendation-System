#Library Book Recommendation System:
A simple and efficient Python-based recommendation tool that suggests books to users based on their preferred genres and reading interests. This project demonstrates basic recommendation logic, user input handling, modular programming, and data management using Python.

#Features
1.Displays available book genres
2.Allows users to select their preferred genre
3.Recommends books based on predefined datasets
4.Supports multiple recommendations
5.Beginner-friendly code structure
6.Fully console-based and easy to use

#Technologies Used
1.Built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries)
2.No external libraries required

#How It Works:
1.The system loads a predefined list of genres and books.
